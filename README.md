# Surf_Shop
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the winter statistics of Oahu, Hawaii; where W. Avy is trying to determine if a year-round ice cream and surf shop would be sustainable. Using this analysis, one can identify the ideal months for the business to grow and how to potentially expand.
## Results
Using the following chart, it is found that the average monthly temperate is 74.9 F, the min temp is 64.0 F, and the max is 85.0 F:

The standard deviation of June (3.26), is lower than the December one (3.75); due to this, it can be inferred that it is more likely that temperatures will stay higher in June than it is in December.
## Summary
Comparing the data between the 2 months shows that June is overall a hotter month than December, but additional data should be collected as well to determine whether one is better, such as the precipitation, since a surf shop has no opportunities when rain is hard. Since Hawaii is an archipelago as well, natural disasters can be very prevalent, so extra precautions should be taken when determining if a business would survive.
